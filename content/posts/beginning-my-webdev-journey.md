I've always wanted to build websites but have never been drawn to webdev like I was drawn to Linux so I've generally steered clear. That was until I came across the website [this cute world](https://thiscute.world) while learning about NixOS. I really liked the websites design and in particular the typing title animation and wanted to build my own. The website was built with Hugo so I decided to start with that.

Learning Hugo however was a long process primarily because I didn't stay consistent with it like I did when learning Linux. I also found the documentation to be difficult to read. I just wanted a basic website that I could slowly build upon as time went on but I never managed to get going. In all honesty this only lasted about a week until I gave up trying to learn it and went back to my usual Linux tinkering. About a year later I revisted Hugo and tried learning it again. I followed this [hugo guide](https://hugo-mini-course.netlify.app) all the way through and felt like I had grasped the basics of Hugo to the point where I could import a theme and begin tinkering. I used the risotto Hugo theme and found the Javascript typed.js library and made myself a cool typing animation title. I also had basically no experience with Javascript but was familiar with programming principles like variables, functions, libraries, etc. so I scraped by.

I was initially going to build a website for a Linux business but instead I decided to build a blog site. A friend asked me why I'm building a blog if no one is likely going to read it (I know bit harsh but yeah it was a valid question) and I told her it's so I can cement my knowledge on topics I enjoy (the same friend also hates my terrible memory). I also wanted to get better at writing too even though AI will be able to do a 1000x better job then me but this blog is for myself so I'm fine with that.
